    <body> 
<p>My midterm project is going to be a food blog of sorts. My best friend and I have been traveling around the city shooting at different <br/> resturants and street food locations for the past two months now. Would love to showcase our photography in this blog.
        <div>       
<p> The best things about food blogging are that not only do you get to photograph  deliculous food you also get to eat it too! <br/> Most of the time we get the food for free! I think one one the best experiences was at a resturant called the <br/>Midwinter kitchen, We must have gotten over $200 in meals drinks and desert. Wont ever forget that.<br/> 
        </div>
<p>You'll definitely be seeing loads of delicicous food pics and awesome places to check out here in the city <br/>
