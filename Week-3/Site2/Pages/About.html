        <p>To sum everything up, I live in NYC, go to FIT and shoot photos and videos. I'm originally from upstate NY. I'm the catskill mountians to be exact. It was a big transition to go from cow pastures, to the bright city lights of NYC. All of my friends thought I was crazy, hell even I thought I was crazy for moving down here. All I can say is that I could never go back to the life style that I once did upstate. I am a true adopted New Yorker now. Below is a little sample of some of the work I've done in the year her in the city. </p>
